# Xylophone-iOS14
## A simple xylophone application written in Swift 5 for devices running iOS 14 and later. 

## Overview

This is a simple iOS application built in Swift 5 that serves as an egg timer. The app allows users to select three cooking levels for their eggs: Soft, Medium, and Hard. When a level is selected, a corresponding timer starts, and a progress bar at the bottom of the screen shows the remaining time. Once the timer reaches zero, an alarm will sound, and the text on the screen will change to "DONE!". This project focuses on control flow and dictionaries as well as utilizing the Swift Timer API. 

## Features

- Musical Notes: The app provides an interactive xylophone experience with seven buttons, each playing a distinct note.
- AVFoundation Integration: Leveraging the power of AVFoundation and AVAudioPlayer, the app ensures high-quality sound playback for an immersive musical experience.
- User-Friendly Interface: The intuitive UI design makes it easy for users to select and play their desired notes, creating a seamless and enjoyable experience.
